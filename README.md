Huawei sign tool is designed to be used in windows based on batch scripting.The tool is tested and known to be working in most cases.The sign tool used public and private keys which are held public and I owe no copyrights or I  held ownership of this. The parts of the program or the method of signing implemented I owe no rights to the files and programs the properity user lies liable to use of it in all manner.

Huawei sign tool has two basic processing methods used 1.Auto all 2.Make all

"Please install python,winrar,7zip to avoid any errors while using"

The sign tool is limited to V4 the v3 will added as on time when finished .

V5 signing is limited to indiviual or R&D development and no public~private keys are available ,so for this concern v5 will be limited to add only merging to be used with loader if aviable from open sources.

*The v3 & v5 will be implemented in the later time since the development of v3 has been available by open sources already and v5 there has been no development since its new with so many security implementations.*

Auto all the scripting is limited to already modified binary to be auto extracted and signed. The signing information is to be predefined in the version.Bat file.

Make all the scripting is used in readily extracted batch file being used and helpful in compiling all possible types of firmware and sign when the user indeed need to change or intercorporate webui,convert existing firmware from one type to another.

Apart from this there is individual method of signing only single type of firmware.
